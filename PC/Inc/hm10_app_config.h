 *
 * @brief   This file should contain all the HM-10 Driver Configurations made by the user/implementor.
 *
 * @note    It is highly suggested not to directly edit the Configurations Settings defined in this file. Instead of
 *          doing that whenever requiring different Configuration Settings, it is suggested to do that instead in this
 *          additional header file named as "hm10_app_config.h". However, to enable the use of that additional header
 *          file, you will also need to change the @ref ENABLE_APP_HM10_CONFIG define, that is located at
 *          @ref HM10_config , to a value of 1.
